"""Single-object trackers for the tennis analyzer extraction pipeline.

Pure data in, pure data out: no OpenCV, no YOLO, no frame pixels. Integration
code calls the detector, hands the raw detections to the tracker, and gets
back the canonical per-frame position. This keeps trackers unit-testable
without model weights.

`PersonTracker` locks onto the player on the first good frame and prefers
IoU-overlap-to-previous on subsequent frames. Fixes the "YOLO picked a
background figure" bug where a small high-confidence false positive
(fence, distant person, net post) beat the large foreground player on
raw confidence.

Racket tracking lives separately; see RacketTracker (next commit) for
the Kalman-filter-based variant that needs to coast through motion-blur
gaps.

    """Kalman-filter single-point tracker for the racket center.

    The racket disappears from YOLO regularly — motion blur at the top of
    a forehand, the racket head leaving the frame during a serve toss,
    the hand briefly occluding the strings. A stateless gate (show when
    conf >= 0.3, else nothing) produces a trail full of gaps. This
    tracker fills short gaps with a constant-velocity prediction and
    only gives up (returns None) after several consecutive miss frames.

    State layout: [cx, cy, vx, vy] in normalized image coordinates, with
    velocity in units of (normalized coord) per second. Working in
    normalized space means the tuning is resolution-independent — a
    1080p and a 720p clip both see a forehand contact as "~0.8
    normalized units per second."

    Why a Kalman filter and not an EMA here (but not for PersonTracker):
    racket motion is ballistic across frames (predictable from velocity),
    and we need to interpolate through miss frames — both are exactly
    what a Kalman filter is for. PersonTracker doesn't need it because a
    person doesn't vanish unpredictably between sampled frames.

    Tunables:
      sigma_a — process-noise acceleration std dev. Must be large enough
        to follow a racket accelerating 0 → 1500 px/s in ~100ms during a
        forehand (≈ 8 normalized/s² on a 1080p frame). Too small = the
        filter lags during contact; too large = noisy predictions during
        the backswing's smooth phase.
      sigma_m — measurement-noise std dev. ~0.01 matches the observed
        frame-to-frame jitter on YOLO bbox centers. Bigger = smoother
        but laggier; smaller = trusts YOLO more.
      association_radius — max allowed distance between the filter's
        prediction and a new YOLO detection for the detection to be
        accepted (otherwise treated as a miss). 0.15 normalized units
        covers the gap a fast wrist can traverse between sampled frames.
      max_coast_frames — after this many consecutive missed detections,
        the filter resets. Short enough to re-lock on the right racket
        after a scene transition; long enough to coast through a swing's
        motion-blur plateau.
      conf_decay / conf_floor — coasted frames don't carry real YOLO
        confidence; we emit `prev_conf × conf_decay` on each coast,
        floored so the short fill is still above the client tracer's
        threshold. Long coasts eventually fall below the floor and
        return None, at which point the forearm fallback takes over.
