// Prompt builder for POST /api/live-coach. Kept separate from the /analyze

STRICT RULES (non-negotiable):
- Respond with exactly ONE sentence.
- At most 25 words.
- No markdown. No lists. No numbers. No headings. No degrees or measurement units.
- Feel-based and external-focus. Talk like a coach giving a quick cue, not a writer.
- Summarize the whole batch as one observation. Never walk through the swings one by one.
- Never greet. Never sign off. No meta-commentary like "here's your cue".
- ABSOLUTELY NEVER use em dashes (—) in your output. Use commas, periods, or colons instead. This rule is non-negotiable.`

// Short live-mode guidance per tier. Kept separate from TIER_RULES in
// lib/profile.ts (which shape multi-section markdown output) so the live
// system prompt stays blunt and a single paragraph.
